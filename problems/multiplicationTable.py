Here are some beginner problems that focus on loops:
Problem 1: Multiplication Table
Write a program that displays the multiplication table for a number entered by the user.
The program should:

Ask the user for a number
Use a loop to print the multiplication table from 1 to 10

"""
#i asked claude to make an easier question kasi di ko mafigure out hha

#print your name multiple times
"""
name = input("Enter your name: ")
for i in range(5):
    print(f"your name: {name}")
"""

"""
Problem: Count to 10
Write a program that counts from 1 to 10 and prints each number.
The program should:

Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
Each number should be on its own line
"""
#for i in range(1, 11):
#    print(i)

#tangina gigil itong problem. dami ko pa pinaggagawa yan lang pala

"""
Problem: Add All Numbers
Write a program that adds up all numbers from 1 to 5.
The program should:

Use a loop to go through numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Add each number to a total
Print the final total at the end

Example output:
The total is: 15
"""
x = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    x += i
print(x) #THIS SHIT HERE PRINTS THE OUTPUT NA AGAD WHICH IS 15
    #print(x)      #this shit here prints every output at i-aadd niya
