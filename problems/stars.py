#printing stars in python using loop

# "i" is oftenly used because of its meaning iteration meaning to repeat. range is number of how many times it will be repeated
for i in range (1, 6):
    #since nasa loob siya ng indent mag start na rin ito ng iteration
    print('*' * i)
    # asterisk multiplied by the iteration. kada row ma-multiply siya

#without ai. paano mo siya gagawing pyramid?
